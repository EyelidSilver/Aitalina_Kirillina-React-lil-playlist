            - "I made this little "Music List" app using React. You can add
            songs you like. There are five genre filter buttons and one button
            for all songs. If you are in the mood for some indie music or folk
            then just push the button. If your favorite song is not so good
            anymore - push the delete button but be careful because it is
            irreversible! That's it. Enjoy!"
